## Description

Tickmate allows you to track any daily occurrences.
It is a is a 1-bit journal, meaning each day is either ticked or not.
You can track anything from habits you wish to build or break to how often you wash your hair.

+ Use a "reversed" track for occurrences you don't want to happen, so they're automatically ticked unless you untick them.
+ You can use the "allow multiple" feature to be able to tick a single day multiple times.
+ With iCloud sync, all your data will be securely synced across all devices.
+ Add customizable widgets for your Home Screen or Today View.
